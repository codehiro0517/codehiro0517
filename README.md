Hi there.
Thanks. I'm glad you found your way to my Github profile.

As a senior full-stack developer, I have had the opportunity to work on several projects with leading companies such as TheoremOne and Chetu for over five years. Through these experiences, I have developed a deep understanding of the e-commerce and startup industries, and I am excited to continue contributing to these dynamic fields in my next role.

What inspires me about the e-commerce and startup industries is their constant evolution and innovation. These industries are always pushing the boundaries of what is possible, and I find it incredibly motivating to be a part of that process. Whether it's developing new technologies or finding creative solutions to complex problems, I am energized by the fast-paced nature of these industries and the opportunities they present for growth and learning.

Along with strong communication skills and exemplary work ethic, I bring my hands-on experience with a wide range of programming languages to the table. I have a comprehensive understanding of web development principles in building scalable and efficient applications. I am a strong problem-solver and dedicated team player who is always willing to learn and adapt to new technologies. In my free time, I enjoy contributing to open-source projects and experimenting with new programming languages.
